This is the current list of things that need to be done with the
c0ntr0l application.  You'll have my undying love and gratitude if you
knock a few items off of this list. 


Shaving a yak:
--------------
- Add a pattern browser for manipulating the patterns in memory via the GUI.


A solid day of work:
--------------------
- Test on Linux
- Test on Windows


Afternoon in a coffee shop
--------------------------
- Setup the py2exe build system

Low hanging fruit:
------------------
- Make the background of the icon transparent (or make a new one entirely)
